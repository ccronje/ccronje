### Hi there 👋

I assist [Bhante Sujato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhante_Sujato) and a community of Pāli scholars with the publication of computer assisted translations of the Early Buddhist Texts to [SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net/).

Here's a bit more [about me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmi-cronje-68a590104/).
